  <p>Let's imagine we have 5 bus stations, which we'll denote by <mark>s_i</mark>:</p>
  <div class="csv math addBorder">
    ;s_1 ;s_2 ;s_3 ;s_4 ;s_5
s_1 ;    ; V  ;    ;    ;
s_2 ; V  ;    ;    ;    ; V
s_3 ;    ;    ;    ; V  ;
s_4 ;    ; V  ; V  ;    ;
s_5 ; V  ;    ;    ; V  ;
  </div>
  <p>This is known as a <i>"table of direct interconnections"</i>.</p>
  <p>The <mark>V</mark> represent connected paths. For instance, on the first
  row starting at <mark>s_1</mark>, reaching the <mark>V</mark>,
  allows us to turn up to get to <mark>s_2</mark>.</p>

  <p>We can see the above table represented in a more graphical way:</p>
  <img src="img/example1.svg" />
  <p>This type of graph is called, well, a <i>graph</i>, and it's a directed
  graph (or <i>digraph</i>), since the direction on which the arrows go does
  matter. It's made up of vertices, joined together by edges (also known as
  lines or directed <b>arcs</b>).</p>

  <p>One can walk from a node to another through different <b>paths</b>. For
  example, <mark>s_4 → s_2 → s_5</mark> is an indirect path of <b>order</b>
  two, because we must use two edges to go from <mark>s_4</mark> to
  <mark>s_5</mark>.</p>

  <p>Let's now represent its adjacency matrix called A which represents the
  same table, but uses <mark>1</mark> instead </mark>V</mark> to represent
  a connection:</p>

  <div class="csv math matrix">
0 ; 1 ; 0 ; 0 ; 0
1 ; 0 ; 0 ; 0 ; 1
0 ; 0 ; 0 ; 1 ; 0
0 ; 1 ; 1 ; 0 ; 0
1 ; 0 ; 0 ; 1 ; 0
  </div>

  <p>This way we can see how the <mark>a_21</mark> element represents the
  connection <mark>s_2 → s_1</mark>, and the <mark>a_51</mark> element the
  <mark>s_5 → s_1</mark> connection, etc.</p>

  <p>In general, <mark>a_ij</mark> represents a connection from
  <mark>s_i → s_j</mark> as long as <mark>a_ij ≥ 1</mark>.</p>

  <p>Working with matrices allows us to have a computable representation of
  any graph, which is very useful.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Graphs have a lot of interesting properties besides being representable
  by a computer. What would happen if, for instance, we calculated
  <mark>A^2</mark>? We obtain the following matrix:</p>

  <div class="csv math matrix">
1 ; 0 ; 0 ; 0 ; 1
1 ; 1 ; 0 ; 1 ; 0
0 ; 1 ; 1 ; 0 ; 0
1 ; 0 ; 0 ; 1 ; 1
0 ; 2 ; 1 ; 0 ; 0
  </div>

  <p>We can interpret this as the paths of order <b>two</b>.</p>
  <p>But what does the element <mark>a_52 = 2</mark> represent? It indicates
  the amount of possible ways to go from <mark>s_5 → s_i → s_2</mark>.</p>

  <p>One can manually multiply the involved row and column to determine which
  element is the one we need to pass through, this way we have the row
  <mark>(1, 0, 0, 1, 0)</mark> and the column <mark>(1, 0, 0, 1, 0)</mark> (on
  vertical). The elements <mark>s_1 ≥ 1</mark> are <mark>s_1</mark> and
  <mark>s_4</mark>. This is, we can go from <mark>s_5</mark> to
  <mark>s_2</mark> via <mark>s_5 → s_1 → s_2</mark> or via
  <mark>s_5 → s_4 → s_2</mark>:</p>
  <img src="img/example2.svg" />

  <p>It's important to note that graphs to not consider self-connections, this
  is, <mark>s_i → s_i</mark> is not allowed; neither we work with multigraphs
  here (those which allow multiple connections, for instance, an arbitrary
  number <mark>n</mark> of times).</p>

  <p>Let's finish with <mark>A^3</mark>:</p>
  <div class="csv math matrix">
1 ; 1 ;   0    ; 1 ; 0
1 ; 2 ;<b>1</b>; 0 ; 1
1 ; 0 ;   0    ; 1 ; 1
1 ; 2 ;   1    ; 1 ; 0
2 ; 0 ;   0    ; 1 ; 2
  </div>

  <p>We can see how the first <mark>1</mark> just appeared on the element
  <mark>a_23</mark>, which means that the shortest path to it is at least
  of order three.</mark>

  <hr />

  <p>A graph is said to be <b>strongly connected</b> as long as there is a
  way to reach <i>all</i> its elements.</p>

  <p>We can see all the available paths until now by simply adding up all the
  direct and indirect ways to reach a node, so for now, we can add
  <mark>A + A^2 + A^3</mark> in such a way that:</p>

  <div class="csv math matrix">
2 ; 2 ; 0 ; 1 ; 1
3 ; 3 ; 1 ; 1 ; 3
1 ; 1 ; 1 ; 2 ; 1
2 ; 3 ; 2 ; 2 ; 1
3 ; 2 ; 1 ; 2 ; 2
  </div>

  <p>There isn't a connection between <mark>s_1</mark> y <mark>s_3</mark> yet.
  If we were to calculate <mark>A^4</mark>:</p>

  <div class="csv math matrix">
1 ; 2 ;<b>1</b>;;
;;;;
;;;;
;;;;
;;;;
  </div>

  <p>We don't need to calculate anymore. We now know that the graph is
  strongly connected!</p>

  <p>Congratulations! You've completed this tiny introduction to graphs.
  Now you can play around with them and design your own connections.</p>

  <p>Hold the left mouse button on the above area and drag it down to create
  a new node, or drag a node to this area to delete it.</p>

  <p>To create new connections, hold the right mouse button on the node you
  want to start with, and drag it to the node you want it to be connected to.</p>

  <p>To delete the connections coming from a specific node, middle click it.</p>

  <table><tr><td style="width:100%;">

    <button onclick="clearNodes()">Clear all the nodes</button>
