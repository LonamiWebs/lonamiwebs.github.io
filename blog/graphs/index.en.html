  <p>Let's imagine we have 5 bus stations, which we'll denote by \(s_i\):</p>

  \(\begin{bmatrix}
  & s_1 & s_2 & s_3 & s_4 & s_5 \\
  s_1   &   & V &   &   &       \\
  s_2   & V &   &   &   & V     \\
  s_3   &   &   &   & V &       \\
  s_4   &   & V & V &   &       \\
  s_5   & V &   &   & V & 
 \end{bmatrix}\)

  <p>This is known as a <i>"table of direct interconnections"</i>.</p>
  <p>The <\(V\) represent connected paths. For instance, on the first
  row starting at \(s_1\), reaching the \(V\),
  allows us to turn up to get to \(s_2\).</p>

  <p>We can see the above table represented in a more graphical way:</p>
  <img src="img/example1.svg" />
  <p>This type of graph is called, well, a <i>graph</i>, and it's a directed
  graph (or <i>digraph</i>), since the direction on which the arrows go does
  matter. It's made up of vertices, joined together by edges (also known as
  lines or directed <b>arcs</b>).</p>

  <p>One can walk from a node to another through different <b>paths</b>. For
  example, \(s_4 \rightarrow s_2 \rightarrow s_5\) is an indirect path of <b>order</b>
  two, because we must use two edges to go from \(s_4\) to
  \(s_5\).</p>

  <p>Let's now represent its adjacency matrix called A which represents the
  same table, but uses <mark>1</mark> instead </mark>V</mark> to represent
  a connection:</p>

  \(\begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}\)

  <p>This way we can see how the \(a_{2,1}\) element represents the
  connection \(s_2 \rightarrow s_1\), and the \(a_{5,1}\) element the
  \(s_5 \rightarrow s_1\) connection, etc.</p>

  <p>In general, \(a_{i,j}\) represents a connection from
    \(s_i \rightarrow s_j\)as long as \(a_{i,j}\geq 1\)>.</p>

  <p>Working with matrices allows us to have a computable representation of
  any graph, which is very useful.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Graphs have a lot of interesting properties besides being representable
  by a computer. What would happen if, for instance, we calculated
  \(A^2\)? We obtain the following matrix:</p>

  \(\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
  1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
  0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}\)

  <p>We can interpret this as the paths of order <b>two</b>.</p>
  <p>But what does the element \(a_{5,2}=2\) represent? It indicates
  the amount of possible ways to go from  \(s_5 \rightarrow s_i \rightarrow s_2\).</p>

  <p>One can manually multiply the involved row and column to determine which
  element is the one we need to pass through, this way we have the row
  \([1 0 0 1 0]\) and the column \([1 0 0 1 0]\) (on
  vertical). The elements \(s_i\geq 1\) are \(s_1\) and
  \(s_4\). This is, we can go from \(s_5\) to
  \(s_2\) via \(s_5 \rightarrow s_1 \rightarrow s_2\) or via
  \(s_5 \rightarrow s_4 \rightarrow s_2\):</p>
  <img src="img/example2.svg" />

  <p>It's important to note that graphs to not consider self-connections, this
  is, \(s_i \rightarrow s_i) is not allowed; neither we work with multigraphs
  here (those which allow multiple connections, for instance, an arbitrary
  number \(n\) of times).</p>

  \(\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 1 & 0          & 1 & 0 \\
  1 & 2 & \textbf{1} & 0 & 1 \\
  1 & 0 & 0          & 1 & 1 \\
  1 & 2 & 1          & 1 & 0 \\
  2 & 0 & 0          & 1 & 2
  \end{bmatrix}\)

  <p>We can see how the first \(1\) just appeared on the element
    \(a_{2,3}\), which means that the shortest path to it is at least
  of order three.</mark>

  <hr />

  <p>A graph is said to be <b>strongly connected</b> as long as there is a
  way to reach <i>all</i> its elements.</p>

  <p>We can see all the available paths until now by simply adding up all the
  direct and indirect ways to reach a node, so for now, we can add
  \(A+A^2+A^3\) in such a way that:</p>

  \(\begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
  3 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\
  1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\
  2 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 \\
  3 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 2
  \end{bmatrix}\)

  <p>There isn't a connection between \(s_1\) and \(s_3\) yet.
  If we were to calculate \(A^4\):</p>

  \(\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 & 1 &   &   \\
    &   &   &   &   \\
    &   &   &   &   \\
    &   &   &   &   \\
    &   &   &   &  
  \end{bmatrix}\)

  <p>We don't need to calculate anymore. We now know that the graph is
  strongly connected!</p>

  <p>Congratulations! You've completed this tiny introduction to graphs.
  Now you can play around with them and design your own connections.</p>

  <p>Hold the left mouse button on the above area and drag it down to create
  a new node, or drag a node to this area to delete it.</p>

  <p>To create new connections, hold the right mouse button on the node you
  want to start with, and drag it to the node you want it to be connected to.</p>

  <p>To delete the connections coming from a specific node, middle click it.</p>
