No tracking, I promise!</noscript><blockquote><p>¿No hablas inglés? <a href="/golb/graphs-es">Lee la versión en español</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Let's imagine we have 5 bus stations, which we'll denote by ((s_i)):</p><div class="matrix"> ' s_1 ' s_2 ' s_3 ' s_4 ' s_5 \\
s_1 ' ' V ' ' ' \\
s_2 ' V ' ' ' ' V \\
s_3 ' ' ' ' V ' \\
s_4 ' ' V ' V ' ' \\
s_5 ' V ' ' ' V '
</div><p>This is known as a <em>"table of direct interconnections"</em>. The ((V)) represent connected paths. For instance, on the first row starting at ((s_1)), reaching the ((V)), allows us to turn up to get to ((s_2)).</p><p>We can see the above table represented in a more graphical way:</p><p><img src="example1.svg" alt="Table 1 as a Graph"></p><p>This type of graph is called, well, a graph, and it's a directed graph (or digraph), since the direction on which the arrows go does matter. It's made up of vertices, joined together by edges (also known as lines or directed <strong>arcs</strong>).</p><p>One can walk from a node to another through different <strong>paths</strong>. For example, ((s_4 $rightarrow s_2 $rightarrow s_5)) is an indirect path of <strong>order</strong> two, because we must use two edges to go from ((s_4)) to ((s_5)).</p><p>Let's now represent its <strong>adjacency</strong> matrix called A which represents the same table, but uses 1 instead V to represent a connection:</p><div class="matrix"> 0 ' 1 ' 0 ' 0 ' 0 \\
1 ' 0 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 \\
0 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 ' 0 \\
0 ' 1 ' 1 ' 0 ' 0 \\
1 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 ' 0
</div><p>This way we can see how the ((a_{2,1})) element represents the connection ((s_2 $rightarrow s_1)), and the ((a_{5,1})) element the ((s_5 $rightarrow s_1)) connection, etc.</p><p>In general, ((a_{i,j})) represents a connection from ((s_i $rightarrow s_j))as long as ((a_{i,j}$geq 1)).</p><p>Working with matrices allows us to have a computable representation of any graph, which is very useful.</p><hr /><p>Graphs have a lot of interesting properties besides being representable by a computer. What would happen if, for instance, we calculated ((A^2))? We obtain the following matrix:</p><div class="matrix"> 1 ' 0 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 \\
1 ' 1 ' 0 ' 1 ' 0 \\
0 ' 1 ' 1 ' 0 ' 0 \\
1 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 ' 1 \\
0 ' 2 ' 1 ' 0 ' 0
</div><p>We can interpret this as the paths of order <strong>two</strong>. But what does the element ((a_{5,2}=2)) represent? It indicates the amount of possible ways to go from ((s_5 $rightarrow s_i $rightarrow s_2)).</p><p>One can manually multiply the involved row and column to determine which element is the one we need to pass through, this way we have the row (([1 0 0 1 0])) and the column (([1 0 0 1 0])) (on vertical). The elements ((s_i·$geq 1)) are ((s_1)) and ((s_4)). This is, we can go from ((s_5)) to ((s_2)) via ((s_5 $rightarrow s_1 $rightarrow s_2)) or via ((s_5 $rightarrow s_4 $rightarrow s_2)):</p><p><img src="example2.svg" alt="Previous table as a graph"></p><p>It's important to note that graphs to not consider self-connections, this is, ((s_i $rightarrow s_i)) is not allowed; neither we work with multigraphs here (those which allow multiple connections, for instance, an arbitrary number ((n)) of times).</p><div class="matrix"> 1 ' 1 ' 0 ' 1 ' 0 \\
1 ' 2 ' #1# ' 0 ' 1 \\
1 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 ' 1 \\
1 ' 2 ' 1 ' 1 ' 0 \\
2 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 ' 2
</div><p>We can see how the first ((1)) just appeared on the element ((a_{2,3})), which means that the shortest path to it is at least of order three.</p><hr /><p>A graph is said to be <strong>strongly connected</strong> as long as there is a way to reach all its elements.</p><p>We can see all the available paths until now by simply adding up all the direct and indirect ways to reach a node, so for now, we can add ((A + A^2 + A^3)) in such a way that:</p><div class="matrix"> 2 ' 2 ' 0 ' 1 ' 1 \\
3 ' 3 ' 1 ' 1 ' 3 \\
1 ' 1 ' 1 ' 2 ' 1 \\
2 ' 3 ' 2 ' 2 ' 1 \\
3 ' 2 ' 1 ' 2 ' 2
</div><p>There isn't a connection between ((s_1)) and ((s_3)) yet. If we were to calculate ((A^4)):</p><div class="matrix"> 1 ' 2 ' 1 ' ' \\
' ' ' ' \\
' ' ' ' \\
' ' ' ' \\
' ' ' '
</div><p>We don't need to calculate anymore. We now know that the graph is strongly connected!</p><hr /><p>Congratulations! You've completed this tiny introduction to graphs.
