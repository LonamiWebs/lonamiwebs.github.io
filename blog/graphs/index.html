No tracking, I promise!</noscript><blockquote><p>Don't know English? <a href=https://lonami.dev/blog/graphs/spanish.html>Read the Spanish version instead</a>.</blockquote><p>Let's imagine we have 5 bus stations, which we'll denote by ((s_i)):<div class=matrix>' s_1 ' s_2 ' s_3 ' s_4 ' s_5 \\ s_1 ' ' V ' ' ' \\ s_2 ' V ' ' ' ' V \\ s_3 ' ' ' ' V ' \\ s_4 ' ' V ' V ' ' \\ s_5 ' V ' ' ' V '</div><p>This is known as a "table of direct interconnections". The ((V)) represent connected paths. For instance, on the first row starting at ((s_1)), reaching the ((V)), allows us to turn up to get to ((s_2)).<p>We can see the above table represented in a more graphical way:<p><img src=https://lonami.dev/blog/graphs/example1.svg alt="Table 1 as a Graph"><p>This type of graph is called, well, a graph, and it's a directed graph (or digraph), since the direction on which the arrows go does matter. It's made up of vertices, joined together by edges (also known as lines or directed arcs).<p>One can walk from a node to another through different paths. For example, ((s_4 $rightarrow s_2 $rightarrow s_5)) is an indirect path of order two, because we must use two edges to go from ((s_4)) to ((s_5)).<p>Let's now represent its adjacency matrix called A which represents the same table, but uses 1 instead V to represent a connection:<div class=matrix>0 ' 1 ' 0 ' 0 ' 0 \\ 1 ' 0 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 \\ 0 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 ' 0 \\ 0 ' 1 ' 1 ' 0 ' 0 \\ 1 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 ' 0</div><p>This way we can see how the ((a_{2,1})) element represents the connection ((s_2 $rightarrow s_1)), and the ((a_{5,1})) element the ((s_5 $rightarrow s_1)) connection, etc.<p>In general, ((a_{i,j})) represents a connection from ((s_i $rightarrow s_j))as long as ((a_{i,j}$geq 1)).<p>Working with matrices allows us to have a computable representation of any graph, which is very useful.<hr><p>Graphs have a lot of interesting properties besides being representable by a computer. What would happen if, for instance, we calculated ((A^2))? We obtain the following matrix:<div class=matrix>1 ' 0 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 \\ 1 ' 1 ' 0 ' 1 ' 0 \\ 0 ' 1 ' 1 ' 0 ' 0 \\ 1 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 ' 1 \\ 0 ' 2 ' 1 ' 0 ' 0</div><p>We can interpret this as the paths of order two. But what does the element ((a_{5,2}=2)) represent? It indicates the amount of possible ways to go from ((s_5 $rightarrow s_i $rightarrow s_2)).<p>One can manually multiply the involved row and column to determine which element is the one we need to pass through, this way we have the row (([1 0 0 1 0])) and the column (([1 0 0 1 0])) (on vertical). The elements ((s_i$geq 1)) are ((s_1)) and ((s_4)). This is, we can go from ((s_5)) to ((s_2)) via ((s_5 $rightarrow s_1 $rightarrow s_2)) or via ((s_5 $rightarrow s_4 $rightarrow s_2)): <img src=example2.svg><p>It's important to note that graphs to not consider self-connections, this is, ((s_i $rightarrow s_i)) is not allowed; neither we work with multigraphs here (those which allow multiple connections, for instance, an arbitrary number ((n)) of times).<div class=matrix>1 ' 1 ' 0 ' 1 ' 0 \\ 1 ' 2 ' \textbf{1} ' 0 ' 1 \\ 1 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 ' 1 \\ 1 ' 2 ' 1 ' 1 ' 0 \\ 2 ' 0 ' 0 ' 1 ' 2</div><p>We can see how the first ((1)) just appeared on the element ((a_{2,3})), which means that the shortest path to it is at least of order three.<hr><p>A graph is said to be strongly connected as long as there is a way to reach all its elements.<p>We can see all the available paths until now by simply adding up all the direct and indirect ways to reach a node, so for now, we can add ((A+A^2+A^3)) in such a way that:<div class=matrix>2 ' 2 ' 0 ' 1 ' 1 \\ 3 ' 3 ' 1 ' 1 ' 3 \\ 1 ' 1 ' 1 ' 2 ' 1 \\ 2 ' 3 ' 2 ' 2 ' 1 \\ 3 ' 2 ' 1 ' 2 ' 2</div><p>There isn't a connection between ((s_1)) and ((s_3)) yet. If we were to calculate ((A^4)):<div class=matrix>1 ' 2 ' 1 ' ' \\ ' ' ' ' \\ ' ' ' ' \\ ' ' ' ' \\ ' ' ' '</div><p>We don't need to calculate anymore. We now know that the graph is strongly connected!<hr><p>Congratulations! You've completed this tiny introduction to graphs.
