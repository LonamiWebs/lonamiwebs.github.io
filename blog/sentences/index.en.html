        <p>Just a few sentences that I've been gathering among the years and I think are worthy of being kept somewhere.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>So far, you've survived 100% of your worst days. You're doing great</li>
          <li>Money is not a concern, perfection is</li>
          <li>The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts today</li>
          <li>Not all cultures deserve respect.</li>
          <li>It's not the same knowing that you're not free that not being free.</li>
          <li>Being alive is not a biolgical matter, rather mental.</li>
          <li>Every mountain starts off as a grain of sand.</li>
          <li>Time goes against desire.</li>
          <li>The only way to respect is fear.</li>
          <li>For those who have nothing I have so much.</li>
          <li>One isn't what they think, it's what they do.</li>
          <li>When your goal seems impossible, don't change the goal. Find new ways to get to it.</li>
          <li>Be the change you wish to see in the world.</li>
          <li>Tell me something, I'll forget. Show me something, I'll remember. But make me part of it and I'll understand it.</li>
          <li>If you want something to happen, go and do it. Or wait sitting like a stupid until it happens that it never happens.</li>
          <li>I'd rather be happy than be right.</li>
          <li>The engines don’t move the ship at all. The ship stays where it is and the engines move the universe around it.</li>

        </ul>
