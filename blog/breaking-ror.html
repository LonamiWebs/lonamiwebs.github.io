**Breaking Risk of Rain**

[Risk of Rain](https://riskofraingame.com/) is a fun little game you can spend a lot of hours on. It's incredibly challenging for new players, and fun once you have learnt the basics. This blog will go through what I've learnt and how to play the game correctly.


Getting Started
===============

If you're new to the game, you may find it frustrating. You must learn very well to dodge.

Your first [character](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters) will be [Commando](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Commando). He's actually a very nice character. Use your third skill (dodge) to move faster, pass through large groups of enemies, and negate fall damage.

If there are a lot of monsters, remember to **leave** from there! It's really important for survival. Most enemies **don't do body damage**. Not even the body of the [Magma Worm](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Magma_Worm) or the [Wandering Vagrant](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Wandering_Vagrant) (just dodge the head and projectiles respectively).

The first thing you must do is always **rush for the teleporter**. Completing the levels quick will make the game easier. But make sure to take note of **where are the chests**! When you have time (even when the countdown finishes), go back for them and buy as many as you can. Generally, prefer [chests](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Chest) over [shrines](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Shrine) since they may eat all your money.

Completing the game on [Drizzle](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Difficulty) is really easy if you follow these tips.


Requisites
==========

Before breaking the game, you must obtain several [artifacts](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Item#Artifacts). We are interested in particular in the following:

* [Sacrifice](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Sacrifice). You really need this one, and may be a bit hard to get. With it, you will be able to farm the first level for 30 minutes and kill the final boss in 30 seconds.
* [Command](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Command). You need this unless you want to grind for hours to get enough of the items you really need for the rest of the game. Getting this one is easy.
* [Glass](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Glass). Your life will be very small (at the beginning…), but you will be able to one-shot everything easily.
* [Kin](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Kin) (optional). It makes it easier to obtain a lot of boxes if you restart the first level until you get [lemurians](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Lemurian) or [jellyfish](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Jellyfish) as the monster, since they're cheap to spawn.

With those, the game becomes trivial. Playing as [Huntress](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Huntress) is excellent since she can move at high speed while killing everything on screen.


Breaking the Game
=================

The rest is easy! With the command artifact you want the following items.

[Common Items](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Common_Items)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Soldier's Syringe](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Soldier's_Syringe). **Stack 13** of these and you will triple your attack speed. You can get started with 4 or so.
* [Paul's Goat Hoof](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Paul's_Goat_Hoof). **Stack +30** of these and your movement speed will be insane. You can get a very good speed with 8 or so.
* [Crowbar](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Crowbar). **Stack +20** to guarantee you can one-shot bosses.

If you want to be safer:
* [Hermit's Scarf](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Hermit's_Scarf). **Stack 6** of these to dodge 1/3 of the attacks.
* [Monster Tooth](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Tooth). **Stack 9** of these to recover 50 life on kill. This is plenty, since you will be killing *a lot*.

If you don't have enough and want more fun, get one of these:
* [Gasoline](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Gasoline). Burn the ground on kill, and more will die!
* [Headstompers](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Headstompers). They make a pleasing sound on fall, and hurt.
* [Lens-Maker's Glasses](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Lens-Maker's_Glasses). **Stack 14** and you will always deal a critical strike for double the damage.

[Uncommon Items](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Uncommon_Items)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Infusion](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Infusion). You only really need one of this. Your life will skyrocket after a while, since this gives you 1HP per kill.
* [Hopoo Feather](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Hopoo_Feather). **Stack +10** of these. You will pretty much be able to fly with so many jumps.
* [Guardian's Heart](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Guardian's_Heart). Not really necessary, but useful for early and late game, since it will absorb infinite damage the first hit.

If, again, you want more fun, get one of these:
* [Ukelele](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Ukulele). Spazz your enemies!
* [Will-o'-the-wisp](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Will-o'-the-wisp). Explode your enemies!
* [Chargefield Generator](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Chargefield_Generator). It should cover your entire screen after a bit, hurting all enemies without moving a finger.
* [Golden Gun](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Golden_Gun). You will be rich, so this gives you +40% damage.
* [Predatory Instincts](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Predatory_Instincts). If you got 14 glasses, you will always be doing critical strikes, and this will give even more attack speed.
* [56 Leaf Clover](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/56_Leaf_Clover). More drops, in case you didn't have enough.

[Rare Items](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Rare_Items)
------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Ceremonial Dagger](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Ceremonial_Dagger). **Stack +3**, then killing one thing kills another thing and makes a chain reaction.
* [Alien Head](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Alien_Head). **Stack 3**, and you will be able to use your abilities more often.

For more fun:
* [Brilliant Behemoth](http://riskofrain.wikia.com/wiki/Brilliant_Behemoth). Boom boom.


Closing Words
=============

You can now beat the game in Monsoon solo with any character. Have fun! And be careful with the sadly common crashes.
