All WorldEdit commands can be used with a double slash (<code>//</code>) so they don't conlict with built-in commands. This means you can get a list of all commands with <code>//help</code>. Let's explore different categories!</p><h2 id="movement"><a href="#movement">Movement</a></h2><p>In order to edit a world properly you need to learn how to move in said world properly. There are several straightforward commands that let you move:</p><ul><li><code>//ascend</code> goes up one floor.</li><li><code>//descend</code> goes down one floor.</li><li><code>//thru</code> let's you pass through walls.</li><li><code>//jumpto</code> to go wherever you are looking.</li></ul><h2 id="information"><a href="#information">Information</a></h2><p>Knowing your world properly is as important as knowing how to move within it, and will also let you change the information in said world if you need to.</p><ul><li><code>//biomelist</code> shows all known biomes.</li><li><code>//biomeinfo</code> shows the current biome.</li><li><code>//setbiome</code> lets you change the biome.</li></ul><h2 id="blocks"><a href="#blocks">Blocks</a></h2><p>You can act over all blocks in a radius around you with quite a few commands. Some won't actually act over the entire range you specify, so 100 is often a good number.</p><h3 id="filling"><a href="#filling">Filling</a></h3><p>You can fill pools with <code>//fill water 100</code> or caves with <code>//fillr water 100</code>, both of which act below your feet.</p><h3 id="fixing"><a href="#fixing">Fixing</a></h3><p>If the water or lava is buggy use <code>//fixwater 100</code> or <code>//fixlava 100</code> respectively.</p><p>Some creeper removed the snow or the grass? Fear not, you can use <code>//snow 10</code> or <code>//grass 10</code>.</p><h3 id="emptying"><a href="#emptying">Emptying</a></h3><p>You can empty a pool completely with <code>//drain 100</code>, remove the snow with <code>//thaw 10</code>, and remove fire with <code>//ex 10</code>.</p><h3 id="removing"><a href="#removing">Removing</a></h3><p>You can remove blocks above and below you in some area with the <code>//removeabove N</code> and <code>//removebelow N</code>. You probably want to set a limit though, or you could fall off the world with <code>//removebelow 1 10</code> for radius and depth. You can also remove near blocks with <code>//removenear block 10</code>.</p><h3 id="shapes"><a href="#shapes">Shapes</a></h3><p>Making a cylinder (or circle) can be done with through <code>//cyl stone 10</code>, a third argument for the height. The radius can be comma-separated to make a ellipses instead, such as <code>//cyl stone 5,10</code>.</p><p>Spheres are done with <code>//sphere stone 5</code>. This will build one right at your center, so you can raise it to be on your feet with <code>//sphere stone 5 yes</code>. Similar to cylinders, you can comma separate the radius <code>x,y,z</code>.</p><p>Pyramids can be done with <code>//pyramic stone 5</code>.</p><p>All these commands can be prefixed with "h" to make them hollow. For instance, <code>//hsphere stone 10</code>.</p><h2 id="regions"><a href="#regions">Regions</a></h2><h3 id="basics"><a href="#basics">Basics</a></h3><p>Operating over an entire region is really important, and the first thing you need to work comfortably with them is a tool to make selections. The default wooden-axe tool can be obtained with <code>//wand</code>, but you must be near the blocks to select. You can use a different tool, like a golden axe, to use as your "far wand" (wand usable over distance). Once you have one in your hand type <code>//farwand</code> to use it as your "far wand". You can select the two corners of your region with left and right click. If you have selected the wrong tool, use <code>//none</code> to clear it.</p><p>If there are no blocks but you want to use your current position as a corner, use <code>//pos1</code> or 2.</p><p>If you made a region too small, you can enlarge it with <code>//expand 10 up</code>, or <code>//expand vert</code> for the entire vertical range, etc., or make it smaller with <code>//contract 10 up</code> etc., or <code>//inset</code> it to contract in both directions. You can use short-names for the cardinal directions (NSEW).</p><p>Finally, if you want to move your selection, you can <code>//shift 1 north</code> it to wherever you need.</p><h3 id="information"><a href="#information">Information</a></h3><p>You can get the <code>//size</code> of the selection or even <code>//count torch</code> in some area. If you want to count all blocks, get their distribution <code>//distr</code>.</p><h3 id="filling"><a href="#filling">Filling</a></h3><p>With a region selected, you can <code>//set</code> it to be any block! For instance, you can use <code>//set air</code> to clear it entirely. You can use more than one block evenly by separting them with a comma <code>//set stone,dirt</code>, or with a custom chance <code>//set 20%stone,80%dirt</code>.</p><p>You can use <code>//replace from to</code> instead if you don't want to override all blocks in your selection.</p><p>You can make an hollow set with <code>//faces</code>, and if you just want the walls, use <code>//walls</code>.</p><h3 id="cleaning"><a href="#cleaning">Cleaning</a></h3><p>If someone destroyed your wonderful snow landscape, fear not, you can use <code>//overlay snow</code> over it (although for this you actually have <code>//snow N</code> and its opposite <code>//thaw</code>).</p><p>If you set some rough area, you can always <code>//smooth</code> it, even more than one time with <code>//smooth 3</code>. You can get your dirt and stone back with <code>//naturalize</code> and put some plants with <code>//flora</code> or <code>//forest</code>, both of which support a density or even the type for the trees. If you already have the dirt use <code>//green</code> instead. If you want some pumpkins, with <code>//pumpkins</code>.</p><h3 id="moving"><a href="#moving">Moving</a></h3><p>You can repeat an entire selection many times by stacking them with <code>//stack N DIR</code>. This is extremely useful to make things like corridors or elevators. For instance, you can make a small section of the corridor, select it entirely, and then repeat it 10 times with <code>//stack 10 north</code>. Or you can make the elevator and then <code>//stack 10 up</code>. If you need to also copy the air use <code>//stackair</code>.</p><p>Finally, if you don't need to repeat it and simply move it just a bit towards the right direction, you can use <code>//move N</code>. The default direction is "me" (towards where you are facing) but you can set one with <code>//move 1 up</code> for example.</p><h3 id="selecting"><a href="#selecting">Selecting</a></h3><p>You can not only select cuboids. You can also select different shapes, or even just points:</p><ul><li><code>//sel cuboid</code> is the default.</li><li><code>//sel extend</code> expands the default.</li><li><code>//sel poly</code> first point with left click and right click to add new points.</li><li><code>//sel ellipsoid</code> first point to select the center and right click to select the different radius.</li><li><code>//sel sphere</code> first point to select the center and one more right click for the radius.</li><li><code>//sel cyl</code> for cylinders, first click being the center.</li><li><code>//sel convex</code> for convex shapes. This one is extremely useful for <code>//curve</code>.</li></ul><h2 id="brushes"><a href="#brushes">Brushes</a></h2><p>Brushes are a way to paint in 3D without first bothering about making a selection, and there are spherical and cylinder brushes with e.g. <code>//brush sphere stone 2</code>, or the shorter form <code>//br s stone</code>. For cylinder, one must use <code>cyl</code> instead <code>sphere</code>.</p><p>There also exists a brush to smooth the terrain which can be enabled on the current item with <code>//br smooth</code>, which can be used with right-click like any other brush.</p><h2 id="clipboard"><a href="#clipboard">Clipboard</a></h2><p>Finally, you can copy and cut things around like you would do with normal text with <code>//copy</code> and <code>//cut</code>. The copy is issued from wherever you issue the command, so when you use <code>//paste</code>, remember that if you were 4 blocks apart when copying, it will be 4 blocks apart when pasting.</p><p>The contents of the clipboard can be flipped to wherever you are looking via <code>//flip</code>, and can be rotated via the <code>//rotate 90</code> command (in degrees).</p><p>To remove the copy use <code>//clearclipboard</code>.</p></article></main><footer><p> Share your thoughts! —
