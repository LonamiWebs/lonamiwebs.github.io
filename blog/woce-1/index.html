It comes with a memory scanner, (dis)assembler, inspection tools and a handful other things. In this series, we will be writing our own tiny Cheat Engine capable of solving all steps of the tutorial, and diving into how it all works underneath.</p><p>Needless to say, we're doing this for private and educational purposes only. One has to make sure to not violate the EULA or ToS of the specific application we're attaching to. This series, much like cheatengine.org, does not condone the illegal use of the code shared.</p><p>Cheat Engine is a tool for Windows, so we will be developing for Windows as well. However, you can also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/12977179/4759433">read memory from Linux-like systems</a>. <a href="https://github.com/scanmem/scanmem">GameConqueror</a> is a popular alternative to Cheat Engine on Linux systems, so if you feel adventurous, you could definitely follow along too! The techniques shown in this series apply regardless of how we read memory from a process. You will learn a fair bit about doing FFI in Rust too.</p><p>We will be developing the application in Rust, because it enables us to interface with the Windows API easily, is memory safe (as long as we're careful with <code>unsafe</code>!), and is speedy (we will need this for later steps in the Cheat Engine tutorial). You could use any language of your choice though. For example, <a href="https://lonami.dev/blog/ctypes-and-windows/">Python also makes it relatively easy to use the Windows API</a>. You don't need to be a Rust expert to follow along, but this series assumes some familiarity with C-family languages. Slightly advanced concepts like the use of <code>unsafe</code> or the <code>MaybeUninit</code> type will be briefly explained. What a <code>fn</code> is or what <code>let</code> does will not be explained.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine/">Cheat Engine's source code</a> is mostly written in Pascal and C. And it's <em>a lot</em> of code, with a very flat project structure, and files ranging in the thousand lines of code each. It's daunting<a href="#fn:1"><sup id="fnref:1">↪1</sup></a>. It's a mature project, with a lot of knowledge encoded in the code base, and a lot of features like distributed scanning or an entire disassembler. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of comments. For these reasons, I'll do some guesswork when possible as to how it's working underneath, rather than actually digging into what Cheat Engine is actually doing.</p><p>With that out of the way, let's get started!</p><h2 id="welcome-to-the-cheat-engine-tutorial"><a href="#welcome-to-the-cheat-engine-tutorial">Welcome to the Cheat Engine Tutorial</a></h2><details open><summary>Cheat Engine Tutorial: Step 1</summary><blockquote><p>This tutorial will teach you the basics of cheating in video games. It will also show you foundational aspects of using Cheat Engine (or CE for short). Follow the steps below to get started.</p><ol><li>Open Cheat Engine if it currently isn't running.</li><li>Click on the "Open Process" icon (it's the top-left icon with the computer on it, below "File".).</li><li>With the Process List window now open, look for this tutorial's process in the list. It will look something like &gt; "00001F98-Tutorial-x86_64.exe" or "0000047C-Tutorial-i386.exe". (The first 8 numbers/letters will probably be different.)</li><li>Once you've found the process, click on it to select it, then click the "Open" button. (Don't worry about all the &gt; other buttons right now. You can learn about them later if you're interested.)</li></ol><p>Congratulations! If you did everything correctly, the process window should be gone with Cheat Engine now attached to the &gt; tutorial (you will see the process name towards the top-center of CE).</p><p>Click the "Next" button below to continue, or fill in the password and click the "OK" button to proceed to that step.)</p><p>If you're having problems, simply head over to forum.cheatengine.org, then click on "Tutorials" to view beginner-friendly &gt; guides!</p></blockquote></details><h2 id="enumerating-processes"><a href="#enumerating-processes">Enumerating processes</a></h2><p>Our first step is attaching to the process we want to work with. But we need a way to find that process in the first place! Having to open the task manager, look for the process we care about, noting down the process ID (PID), and slapping it in the source code is not satisfying at all. Instead, let's enumerate all the processes from within the program, and let the user select one by typing its name.</p><p>From a quick <a href="https://ddg.gg/winapi%20enumerate%20all%20processes">DuckDuckGo search</a>, we find an official tutorial for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/psapi/enumerating-all-processes">Enumerating All Processes</a>, which leads to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/psapi/nf-psapi-enumprocesses"><code>EnumProcesses</code></a> call. Cool! Let's slap in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/winapi"><code>winapi</code></a> crate on <code>Cargo.toml</code>, because I don't want to write all the definitions by myself:</p><pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
winapi = { version = "0.3.9", features = ["psapi"] }
</code></pre><p>Because <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/psapi/nf-psapi-enumprocesses"><code>EnumProcesses</code></a> is in <code>Psapi.h</code> (you can see this in the online page of its documentation), we know we'll need the <code>psapi</code> crate feature. Another option is to search for it in the <a href="https://docs.rs/winapi/"><code>winapi</code> documentation</a> and noting down the parent module where its stored.</p><p>The documentation for the method has the following remark:</p><blockquote><p>It is a good idea to use a large array, because it is hard to predict how many processes there will be at the time you call <strong>EnumProcesses</strong>.</p></blockquote><p><em>Sidenote: reading the documentation for the methods we'll use from the Windows API is extremely important. There's a lot of gotchas involved, so we need to make sure we're extra careful.</em></p><p>1024 is a pretty big number, so let's go with that:</p><pre><code class="language-rust">use std::io;
use std::mem;
use winapi::shared::minwindef::{DWORD, FALSE};

pub fn enum_proc() -&gt; io::Result&lt;Vec&lt;u32&gt;&gt; {
    let mut pids = Vec::&lt;DWORD&gt;::with_capacity(1024);
    let mut size = 0;
    // SAFETY: the pointer is valid and the size matches the capacity.
    if unsafe {
        winapi::um::psapi::EnumProcesses(
            pids.as_mut_ptr(),
            (pids.capacity() * mem::size_of::&lt;DWORD&gt;()) as u32,
            &amp;mut size,
        )
    } == FALSE
    {
        return Err(io::Error::last_os_error());
    }

    todo!()
}
</code></pre><p>We allocate enough space<a href="#fn:2"><sup id="fnref:2">↪2</sup></a> for 1024 <code>pids</code> in a vector<a href="#fn:3"><sup id="fnref:3">↪3</sup></a>, and pass a mutable pointer to the contents to <code>EnumProcesses</code>. Note that the size of the array is in <em>bytes</em>, not items, so we need to multiply the capacity by the size of <code>DWORD</code>. The API likes to use <code>u32</code> for sizes, unlike Rust which uses <code>usize</code>, so we need a cast.</p><p>Last, we need another mutable variable where the amount of bytes written is stored, <code>size</code>.</p><blockquote><p>If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror"><code>GetLastError</code></a>.</p></blockquote><p>That's precisely what we do. If it returns false (zero), we return the last OS error. Rust provides us with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/struct.Error.html#method.last_os_error"><code>std::io::Error::last_os_error</code></a>, which essentially makes that same call but returns a proper <code>io::Error</code> instance. Cool!</p><blockquote><p>To determine how many processes were enumerated, divide the <em>lpcbNeeded</em> value by <code>sizeof(DWORD)</code>.</p></blockquote><p>Easy enough:</p><pre><code class="language-rust">let count = size as usize / mem::size_of::&lt;DWORD&gt;();
// SAFETY: the call succeeded and count equals the right amount of items.
unsafe { pids.set_len(count) };
Ok(pids)
</code></pre><p>Rust doesn't know that the memory for <code>count</code> items were initialized by the call, but we do, so we make use of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.set_len"><code>Vec::set_len</code></a> call to indicate this. The Rust documentation even includes a FFI similar to our code!</p><p>Let's give it a ride:</p><pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    dbg!(enum_proc().unwrap().len());
}
</code></pre><pre>&gt;cargo run

     Running `target\debug\memo.exe`
[src\main.rs:27] enum_proc().unwrap().len() = 178
</pre><p>It works! But currently we only have a bunch of process identifiers, with no way of knowing which process they refer to.</p><blockquote><p>To obtain process handles for the processes whose identifiers you have just obtained, call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess"><code>OpenProcess</code></a> function.</p></blockquote><p>Oh!</p><h2 id="opening-a-process"><a href="#opening-a-process">Opening a process</a></h2><p>The documentation for <code>OpenProcess</code> also contains the following:</p><blockquote><p>When you are finished with the handle, be sure to close it using the <a href="closehandle"><code>CloseHandle</code></a> function.</p></blockquote><p>This sounds to me like the perfect time to introduce a custom <code>struct Process</code> with an <code>impl Drop</code>! We're using <code>Drop</code> to cleanup resources, not behaviour, so it's fine. <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-leave-auto-trait-for-reliable-destruction/13825">Using <code>Drop</code> to cleanup behaviour is a bad idea</a>. But anyway, let's get back to the code:</p><pre><code class="language-rust">use std::ptr::NonNull;
use winapi::ctypes::c_void;

pub struct Process {
    pid: u32,
    handle: NonNull&lt;c_void&gt;,
}

impl Process {
    pub fn open(pid: u32) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Self&gt; {
        todo!()
    }
}

impl Drop for Process {
    fn drop(&amp;mut self) {
        todo!()
    }
}
</code></pre><p>For <code>open</code>, we'll want to use <code>OpenProcess</code> (and we also need to add the <code>processthreadsapi</code> feature to the <code>winapi</code> dependency in <code>Cargo.toml</code>). It returns a <code>HANDLE</code>, which is a nullable mutable pointer to <code>c_void</code>. If it's null, the call failed, and if it's non-null, it succeeded and we have a valid handle. This is why we use Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ptr/struct.NonNull.html"><code>NonNull</code></a>:</p><pre><code class="language-rust">// SAFETY: the call doesn't have dangerous side-effects.
NonNull::new(unsafe { winapi::um::processthreadsapi::OpenProcess(0, FALSE, pid) })
    .map(|handle| Self { pid, handle })
    .ok_or_else(io::Error::last_os_error)
</code></pre><p><code>NonNull</code> will return <code>Some</code> if the pointer is non-null. We map the non-null pointer to a <code>Process</code> instance with <code>Self { .. }</code>. <code>ok_or_else</code> converts the <code>Option</code> to a <code>Result</code> with the error builder function we provide if it was <code>None</code>.</p><p>The first parameter is a bitflag of permissions we want to have. For now, we can leave it as zero (all bits unset, no specific permissions granted). The second one is whether we want to inherit the handle, which we don't, and the third one is the process identifier. Let's close the resource handle on <code>Drop</code> (after adding <code>handleapi</code> to the crate features):</p><pre><code class="language-rust">// SAFETY: the handle is valid and non-null.
unsafe { winapi::um::handleapi::CloseHandle(self.handle.as_mut()) };
</code></pre><p><code>CloseHandle</code> can actually fail (for example, on double-close), but given our invariants, it won't. You could add an <code>assert!</code> to panic if this is not the case.</p><p>We can now open processes, and they will be automatically closed on <code>Drop</code>. Does any of this work though?</p><pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut success = 0;
    let mut failed = 0;
    enum_proc().unwrap().into_iter().for_each(|pid| match Process::open(pid) {
        Ok(_) =&gt; success += 1,
        Err(_) =&gt; failed += 1,
    });

To get the "name" of a process, we need to enumerate the modules that it has loaded, and only then can we get the module base name.

</code></pre><p>Similar to how we did with <code>EnumProcesses</code>, we create a buffer that will hold the ASCII string of the module's base name<a href="#fn:5"><sup id="fnref:5">↪5</sup></a>. The call wants us to pass a pointer to a mutable buffer of <code>i8</code>, but Rust's <code>String::from_utf8</code> wants a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>, so instead we declare a buffer of <code>u8</code> and <code>.cast()</code> the pointer in the call. You could also do this with <code>as _</code>, and Rust would infer the right type, but <code>cast</code> is neat.</p><p>We <code>unwrap</code> the creation of the UTF-8 string because the buffer should contain only ASCII characters (which are also valid UTF-8).
