That something can be anything, and depends entirely on your problem!<p>For example, a recipe to cook some really nice food is an algorithm: it guides you, step by step, to cook something nice. People dealing with mathemathics also apply algorithms to transform their data. And computers <em>love</em> algorithms, too!<p>In reality, any computer program can basically be thought as an algorithm. It contains a series of instructions for the computer to execute. Running them is a process that takes time, consumes input and produces output. This is also why terms like «procedure» come up when talking about them.<p>Computer programs (their algorithms) are normally written in some more specific language, like Java or Python. The instructions are very clear here, which is what we need! A natural language like English is a lot harder to process, and ambiguous. I’m sure you’ve been in arguments because the other person didn’t understand you!<h2 id=references>References</h2><ul><li>algorithm – definition and meaning: <a href=https://www.wordnik.com/words/algorithm>https://www.wordnik.com/words/algorithm</a><li>Algorithm: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm</a><li>What is a «computer algorithm»?: <a href=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/what-is-a-computer-algorithm.htm>https://computer.howstuffworks.com/what-is-a-computer-algorithm.htm</a></ul></main><footer><div><p>Share your thoughts! — <a href=mailto:totufals@hotmail.com><img alt=Mail src=/img/mail.svg></a></div></footer></article><p class=abyss onclick=egg()>Gaze into the abyss… Oh hi there!</p><script>const egg = () => {
