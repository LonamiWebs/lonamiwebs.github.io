NoSQL RethinkDB 3ª Fase. Aplicación.</p><p>It starts with an introduction, properly explaining what database they have chosen and why, but not what application they will be making.</p><p>This is detailed just below in the next section, although it’s a bit vague.</p><p>The next section talks about the Python dependencies that are required, but they never said they would be making a Python application or that we need to install Python!</p><p>The next section talks about the file structure of the project, and they detail what everything part does, although I have missed some code snippets.</p><p>The final result is pretty cool and contains many interesting graphs, they provide a download to the source code and list all the relevant references used.</p><p>Except for a weird «necesario falta» in the text, it’s otherwise well-written, although given the issues above I cannot grade it with the highest score.</p></article></main><footer><p> Share your thoughts! —
