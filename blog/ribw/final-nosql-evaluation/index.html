NoSQL RethinkDB 3ª Fase. Aplicación.<p>It starts with an introduction, properly explaining what database they have chosen and why, but not what application they will be making.<p>This is detailed just below in the next section, although it’s a bit vague.<p>The next section talks about the Python dependencies that are required, but they never said they would be making a Python application or that we need to install Python!<p>The next section talks about the file structure of the project, and they detail what everything part does, although I have missed some code snippets.<p>The final result is pretty cool and contains many interesting graphs, they provide a download to the source code and list all the relevant references used.<p>Except for a weird «necesario falta» in the text, it’s otherwise well-written, although given the issues above I cannot grade it with the highest score.</main><footer><div><p>Share your thoughts! — <a href=mailto:totufals@hotmail.com><img alt=Mail src=/img/mail.svg></a></div></footer></article><p class=abyss onclick=egg()>Gaze into the abyss… Oh hi there!</p><script>const egg = () => {
