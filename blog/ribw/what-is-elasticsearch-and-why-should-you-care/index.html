It’s like a database and search engine on steroids, really easy and fast to get up and running. One can think of it as your own Google, a search engine with analytics.</p><p>ElasticSearch is rich, stable, performs well, is well maintained, and able to scale to petabytes of any kind of data, whether it’s structured, semi-structured or not at all. It’s cost-effective and can be used to make business decisions.</p><p>Or, described in 10 seconds:</p><blockquote><p>Schema-free, REST &amp; JSON based distributed document store Open source: Apache License 2.0 Zero configuration</p></blockquote><p>-- Alex Reelsen</p><h2 id="basic-capabilities"><a href="#basic-capabilities">Basic capabilities</a></h2><p>ElasticSearch lets you ask questions about your data, not just make queries. You may think SQL can do this too, but what’s important is making a pipeline of facets, and feed the results from query to query.</p><p>Instead of changing your data, you can be flexible with your questions with no need to re-index it every time the questions change.</p><p>ElasticSearch is not just to search for full-text data, either. It can search for structured data and return more than just the results. It also yields additional data, such as ranking, highlights, and allows for pagination.</p><p>It doesn’t take a lot of configuration to get running, either, which can be a good boost on productivity.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work"><a href="#how-does-it-work">How does it work?</a></h2><p>ElasticSearch depends on Java, and can work in a distributed cluster if you execute multiple instances. Data will be replicated and sharded as needed. The current version at the time of writing is 7.6.1, and it’s being developed fast!</p><p>It also has support for plugins, with an ever-growing ecosystem and integration on many programming languages. Tools around it are being built around it, too, like Kibana which helps you visualize your data.</p><p>The way you use it is through a JSON API, served over HTTP/S.</p><h2 id="how-can-i-use-it"><a href="#how-can-i-use-it">How can I use it?</a></h2><p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/">You can try ElasticSearch out for free on Elastic Cloud</a>, however, it can also be <a href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch">downloaded and ran offline</a>, which is what we’ll do. Download the file corresponding to your operating system, unzip it, and execute the binary. Running it is as simple as that!</p><p>Now you can make queries to it over HTTP, with for example <code>curl</code>:</p><pre>curl -X PUT localhost:9200/orders/order/1 -d '
{
  "created_at": "2013/09/05 15:45:10",
  "items": [
    {
      name: "HD Monitor"
    }
  ],
  "total": 249.95
}'
</pre><p>This will create a new order with some information, such as when it was created, what items it contains, and the total cost of the order.</p><p>You can then query or filter as needed, script it or even create statistics.</p><h2 id="references"><a href="#references">References</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/sKnkQSec1U0">YouTube – What is Elasticsearch?</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/yWNiRC_hUAw">YouTube – GOTO 2013 • Elasticsearch – Beyond Full-text Search • Alex Reelsen</a></li><li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana">Kibana – Your window into the Elastic Stack</a></li><li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html">Elastic Stack and Product Documentation</a></li></ul></article></main><footer><p> Share your thoughts! —
