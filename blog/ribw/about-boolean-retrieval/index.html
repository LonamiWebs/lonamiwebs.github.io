However, this falls short when the volume of the data grows, more complex queries are desired, or one seeks some sort of ranking.<p>To avoid linear scanning, we build an <em>index</em> and record for each document whether it contains each term out of our full dictionary of terms (which may be words in a chapter and words in the book). This results in a binary term-document <em>incidence matrix</em>. Such a possible matrix is:<table><tbody><tr><td><em> word/play </em><td><strong> Antony and Cleopatra </strong><td><strong> Julius Caesar </strong><td><strong> The Tempest </strong><td><strong> … </strong><tr><td><strong> Antony </strong><td>1<td>1<td>0<td><tr><td><strong> Brutus </strong><td>1<td>1<td>0<td><tr><td><strong> Caesar </strong><td>1<td>1<td>0<td><tr><td><strong> Calpurnia </strong><td>0<td>1<td>0<td><tr><td><strong> Cleopatra </strong><td>1<td>0<td>0<td><tr><td><strong> mercy </strong><td>1<td>0<td>1<td><tr><td><strong> worser </strong><td>1<td>0<td>1<td><tr><td><strong> … </strong><td><td><td><td></table><p>We can look at this matrix’s rows or columns to obtain a vector for each term indicating where it appears, or a vector for each document indicating the terms it contains.<p>Now, answering a query such as <code>Brutus AND Caesar AND NOT Calpurnia</code> becomes trivial:<pre><code>VECTOR(Brutus) AND VECTOR(Caesar) AND COMPLEMENT(VECTOR(Calpurnia))
= 110 AND 110 AND COMPLEMENT(010)
= 110 AND 110 AND 101
= 100
</code></pre><p>The query is only satisfied for our first column.<p>The <em>Boolean retrieval model</em> is thus a model that treats documents as a set of terms, in which we can perform any query in the form of Boolean expressions of terms, combined with <code>OR</code>, <code>AND</code>, and <code>NOT</code>.<p>Now, building such a matrix is often not feasible due to the sheer amount of data (say, a matrix with 500,000 terms across 1,000,000 documents, each with roughly 1,000 terms). However, it is important to notice that most of the terms will be <em>missing</em> when examining each document. In our example, this means 99.8% or more of the cells will be 0. We can instead record the <em>positions</em> of the 1’s. This is known as an <em>inverted index</em>.<p>The inverted index is a dictionary of terms, each containing a list that records in which documents it appears (<em>postings</em>). Applied to boolean retrieval, we would:<ol><li>Collects the documents to be indexed, assign a unique identifier each<li>Tokenize the text in the documents into a list of terms<li>Normalize the tokens, which now become indexing terms<li>Index the documents</ol><table><tbody><tr><td><strong> Dictionary </strong><td><strong> Postings </strong><tr><td>Brutus<td>1, 2, 4, 11, 31, 45, 173, 174<tr><td>Caesar<td>1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 16, 57, 132, …<tr><td>Calpurnia<td>2, 31, 54, 101<tr><td>…<td></table><p>Sort the pairs <code>(term, document_id)</code> so that the terms are alphabetical, and merge multiple occurences into one. Group instances of the same term and split again into a sorted list of postings.<table><tbody><tr><td><strong> term </strong><td><strong> document_id </strong><tr><td>I<td>1<tr><td>did<td>1<tr><td>…<td><tr><td>with<td>2</table><table><tbody><tr><td><strong> term </strong><td><strong> document_id </strong><tr><td>be<td>2<tr><td>brutus<td>1<tr><td>brutus<td>2<tr><td>…<td></table><table><tbody><tr><td><strong> term </strong><td><strong> frequency </strong><td><strong> postings list </strong><tr><td>be<td>1<td>2<tr><td>brutus<td>2<td>1, 2<tr><td>capitol<td>1<td>1<tr><td>…<td><td></table><p>Intersecting posting lists now becomes of transversing both lists in order:<pre><code>Brutus   : 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 11 -> 31 -> 45 ->           173 -> 174
Calpurnia:      2 ->            31 ->       54 -> 101
Intersect:      2 ->            31
</code></pre><p>A simple conjunctive query (e.g. <code>Brutus AND Calpurnia</code>) is executed as follows:<ol><li>Locate <code>Brutus</code> in the dictionary<li>Retrieve its postings<li>Locate <code>Calpurnia</code> in the dictionary<li>Retrieve its postings<li>Intersect (<em>merge</em>) both postings</ol><p>Since the lists are sorted, walking both of them can be done in <em>O(n)</em> time. By also storing the frequency, we can optimize the order in which we execute arbitrary queries, although we won’t go into detail.<h2 id=thoughts>Thoughts</h2><p>The boolean retrieval model can be implemented with relative ease, and can help with storage and efficient querying of the information if we intend to perform boolean queries.<p>However, the basic design lacks other useful operations, such as a «near» operator, or the ability to rank the results.<p>All in all, it’s an interesting way to look at the data and query it efficiently.</main><footer><div><p>Share your thoughts! — <a href=mailto:totufals@hotmail.com><img alt=Mail src=/img/mail.svg></a></div></footer></article><p class=abyss onclick=egg()>Gaze into the abyss… Oh hi there!</p><script>const egg = () => {
