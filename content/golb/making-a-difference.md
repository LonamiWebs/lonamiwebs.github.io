When I've thought about what "making a difference" means, I've always seen it as having to do something at very large scales. Something that changes everyone's lives. But I've realized that it doesn't need the case.

I'm thinking about certain people. I'm thinking about middle-school.

I'm thinking about my math teacher, who I remember saying that if he made a student fail with a grade very close to passing, then he would be a bad teacher because he could just "let them pass". But if he just passed that one student, he would fail as a teacher, because it's his job to get people to actually *learn* his subject. He didn't want to be mean, he was just trying to have everybody properly learn the subject. That made a difference on me, but I never got the chance to thank him.

I'm thinking about my English teacher, who has had to put up with a lot of stupidity from the rest of students, making the class not enjoyable. But I thought she was nice, and she thought I was nice. I remember of a day when she was grading my assignement and debating what grade I should get. I thought to myself, she should just grade whatever she considered fair. But she went something along the lines of "what the heck, you deserve it", and graded in my favour. I think of her as an honest person who also just wants to make other people learn, despite the other students not liking her much. I never got a chance to thank her.

I'm thinking about my philosophy teacher, who was a nice chap. He tried to make the lectures fun and had some really interesting ways of thinking. He was nice to talk to overall, but I never got to thank him for what he taught us.

I'm thinking about one of my lecturers at university who has let me express my feelings to her and helped me make the last push I needed to finish my university degree (I was really dreading some subjects and considering dropping out, but those days are finally over).

I'm thinking about all the people who has been in a long-distance relationship with me. None of the three I've had have worked out in the long-term so far, and I'm in a need of a break from those. But they were really invaluable to help me grow and learn a lot about how things actually work. I'm okay with the first two people now, maybe the third one can be my friend once more in the future as well. I'm sure I've told them how important they have been to me and my life.

I'm thinking about all the people who I've met online and have had overall a healthy relation, sharing interesting things between each other, playtime, thoughts, and other various lessons.

What I'm trying to get across is that you may be more impactful than you think you really are. And even if people don't say it, some are extremely thankful of your interactions with them. You can see this post as a sort of a "call for action" to be more thankful to the people that have affected you in important ways. If people take things for granted because they Just Work, the person who made those things should be proud of this achievement.

Thanks to all of them, to everyone who has shared good moments with me, and to all the people who enjoy the things I make.
