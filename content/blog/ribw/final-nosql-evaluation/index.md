This evaluation is a bit different to my [previous one](/blog/ribw/16/nosql-evaluation/) because this time I have been tasked to evaluate the student `a(i - 2)`, and because I am `a = 9` that happens to be `a(7) =` Classmate.

Unfortunately for Classmate, the only entry related to NoSQL I have found in their blog is Prima y segunda Actividad: Base de datos NoSQL which does not develop an application as requested for the third entry (as of 14th of May).

This means that, instead, I will evaluate `a(i - 3)` which happens to be `a(6) =` Classmate and they do have an entry.

## Classmate’s Evaluation

**Grading: B.**

The post I have evaluated is BB.DD. NoSQL RethinkDB 3ª Fase. Aplicación.

It starts with an introduction, properly explaining what database they have chosen and why, but not what application they will be making.

This is detailed just below in the next section, although it’s a bit vague.

The next section talks about the Python dependencies that are required, but they never said they would be making a Python application or that we need to install Python!

The next section talks about the file structure of the project, and they detail what everything part does, although I have missed some code snippets.

The final result is pretty cool and contains many interesting graphs, they provide a download to the source code and list all the relevant references used.

Except for a weird «necesario falta» in the text, it’s otherwise well-written, although given the issues above I cannot grade it with the highest score.
