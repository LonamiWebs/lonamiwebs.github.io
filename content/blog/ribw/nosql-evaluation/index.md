I have decided to evaluate Classmate‘s post and Classmate‘s post, because they review databases I have not seen or used before, and I think it would be interesting to see new ones.

The evaluation is based on the requirements defined by Trabajos en grupo sobre Bases de Datos NoSQL:

> **1ª entrada:** Descripción de la finalidad de la tecnología y cómo funciona o trabaja la BD NoSQL, sus características, la arista que ocupa en el Teorema CAP, de dónde se descarga, y cómo se instala.

-- Teacher

## Classmate’s evaluation

**Grading: A.**

The post I have evaluated is BB.DD. NoSQL: Voldemort 1ª Fase.

The post doesn’t start very well, because the first sentence has (emphasis mine):

> En él repasaremos en qué consiste **MongoDB**, sus características, y cómo se instala, entre otros.

-- Classmate

…yet the post is about Voldemort!

The post does detail how it works, its architecture, corner in the CAP theorem, download and installation.

I have graded the post with A because I think it meets all the requirements, even if they slipped a bit in the beginning.

## Classmate’s evaluation

**Grading: A.**

The post I have evaluted is Raven.

They have done a good job describing the project’s goals, corner in the CAP theorem, download, and provide an extensive installation section.

They don’t seem to use some of WordPress features, such as lists, but otherwise the post is good and deserves an A grading.
