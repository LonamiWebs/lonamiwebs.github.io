During university, there were a few subjects where I had to write blog posts for (either as evaluable tasks or just for fun). I thought it was really fun and I wanted to preserve that work here, with the hopes it's interesting to someone.

The posts series were auto-generated from the original HTML files and manually anonymized later.
