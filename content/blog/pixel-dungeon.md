[Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://shatteredpixel.com/shatteredpd/) is the classic roguelike RPG game with randomly-generated dungeons. As a new player, it was a bit frustrating to be constantly killed on the first levels of the dungeon, but with some practice it's easy to reach high levels if you can kill the first boss.

Basic Tips
----------

The game comes with its own tips, but here's a short and straight-forward summary:

* **Don't rush into enemies**. Abuse doors and small corridors to kill them one by one. You can use the clock on the bottom left to wait a turn without moving.
* **Explore each level at full**. You will find goodies and gain XP while doing so.
* **Upon finding a special room** (e.g. has a chest but is protected by piranhas), drink all potions that you found in that level until there's one that helps you (e.g. be invisible so piranhas leave you alone). There is guaranteed to be a helpful one per level with special rooms.
* **Drink potions as early as possible**. Harmful potions do less damage on early levels (and if you die, you lose less). This will keep them identified early for the rest of the game.
* **Read scrolls as early as possible** as well. This will keep them identified. It may be worth to wait until you have an item which may be cursed and until the level is clear, because some scrolls clean curses and others alert enemies.
* **Food and health are resources** that you have to *manage*, not keep them always at full. Even if you are starving and taking damage, you may not need to eat *just yet*, since food is scarce. Eat when you are low on health or in possible danger.
* **Piranhas**. Seriously, just leave them alone if you are melee. They're free food if you're playing ranged, though.
* **Prefer armor over weapons**. And make sure to identify or clean it from curses before wearing anything!
* **Find a dew vial early**. It's often a better idea to store dew (health) for later than to use it as soon as possible.

Bosses
------

There is a boss every 5 levels.

* **Level 5 boss**. Try to stay on water, but don't let *it* stay on water since it will heal. Be careful when he starts enraging.
* **Level 10 boss**. Ranged weapons are good against it.
* **Level 15 boss**. I somehow managed to tank it with a health potion.
* **Level 20 boss**. I didn't get this far just yet. You are advised to use scrolls of magic mapping in the last levels to skip straight to the boss, since there's nothing else of value.
* **Level 25 boss**. The final boss. Good job if you made it this far!

Mage
----

If you followed the basic tips, you will sooner or later make use of two scrolls of upgrade in a single run. This will unlock the mage class, which is ridiculously powerful. He starts with a ranged-weapon, a magic missile wand, which is really helpful to keep enemies at a distance. Normally, you want to use this at first to surprise attack them soon, and if you are low on charges, you may go melee on normal enemies if you are confident.

Luck
----

This game is all about luck and patience! Some runs will be better than others, and you should thank and pray the RNG gods for them. If you don't, they will only give you cursed items and not a single scroll to clean them. So, good luck and enjoy playing!
