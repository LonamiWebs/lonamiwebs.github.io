This evaluation is a bit different to my [previous one](/blog/mdad/nosql-evaluation/) because this time I have been tasked to evaluate student `a(i - 2)`, and because I am `i = 11` that happens to be `a(9) =` a classmate.

## Classmate’s Evaluation

**Grading: A.**

The post I have evaluated is Trabajo en grupo – Bases de datos NoSQL, 3ª entrada: Aplicación con una Base de datos NoSQL seleccionada.

It starts with a very brief introduction with who has written the post, what data they will be using, and what database they have chosen.

They properly describe their objective, how they will do it and what library will be used.

They also explain where they obtain the data from, and what other things the site can do, which is a nice bonus.

The post continues listing and briefly explaining all the tools used and what they are for, including commands to execute.

At last, they list what files their project uses, what they do, and contains a showcase of images which lets the reader know what the application does.

All in all, in my opinion, it’s clear they have put work into this entry and I have not noticed any major flaws, so they deserve the highest grade.
