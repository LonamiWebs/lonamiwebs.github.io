Algorithms are a sequence of instructions that can be followed to achieve _something_. That something can be anything, and depends entirely on your problem!

For example, a recipe to cook some really nice food is an algorithm: it guides you, step by step, to cook something nice. People dealing with mathemathics also apply algorithms to transform their data. And computers _love_ algorithms, too!

In reality, any computer program can basically be thought as an algorithm. It contains a series of instructions for the computer to execute. Running them is a process that takes time, consumes input and produces output. This is also why terms like «procedure» come up when talking about them.

Computer programs (their algorithms) are normally written in some more specific language, like Java or Python. The instructions are very clear here, which is what we need! A natural language like English is a lot harder to process, and ambiguous. I’m sure you’ve been in arguments because the other person didn’t understand you!
