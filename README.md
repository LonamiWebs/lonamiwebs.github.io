Typo fixes to the `content` are welcome.

Changes elsewhere will *not* be considered. This is my personal website.
The `build` code *is* open source though, so you can make use of it as the license allows.

**Only the `build` code has a license.**
You are allowed to cite the published `content` and copy excerpts of it to other spaces,
